## /whoami

A geek, I really enjoy new technology, mostly because there is always something
new to learn. I used to work as a Premier Field Engineer at Microsoft
specializing in Windows and Configuration Manager. The time spent there was
a lot of fun. Now I work as a IT Manager for a non-profit organization. Less tech, more painting the future. Still having a lot to do with technology and getting to work with the cloud and our on-prem infrastructure.
  
As everyone who's in tech knows, it's really hard to just leave the tinkering
behind, so now I do that at home in my own personal projects and write about it
here.

## Tech ramblings of a geek

This page serves as my notes for things I find interesting. I used to be a very
active blogger but these days time does not permit a lot of blogging so this
page serves as a place I can organize notes and share the information if it
ever would help someone else.
  
Word of warning though, sometimes it might contain my own opinions, and opinions
are like as*es, everyone has one, so don't get offended. Like, **vi** is > than
**Emacs** :D

## Page served from GitHub

The page is served with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") the static page
generator and it's hosted on GitHub pages. In 2020 the blog was moved from a
Wordpress.com instance to here. As the content is quite static, and I don't
do any advertising on the page the free GitHub service is perfect.
