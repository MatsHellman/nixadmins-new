I've looked at my blog from time to time all these years when it's been
laying dormant. I used to be a active blogger years ago but then life got 
in the way, I did not have the time for it anymore. At the time I was traveling
more than half the days in a year and updating a blog on the side just
wasn't doable.

# Vacation project

In Finland everyone working a steady job has at least 5 weeks of vacation.
Usually we take 4 weeks in the summer and 1 week in the winter. This year the weather isn't great so I decided one of my summer projects when spending time
inside the house would be getting my blog up and running again.

## Hugo

In 2020 I moved my blog from Wordpress.com to a github and started using Hugo to create the pages. 5 years later I have no idea how I set it up. I tried creating a new page and publishing it to the site but that did not work.  

Since I had to relearn the process I decided to go hunting for a nice minimal theme to start form and redo the whole page. This would also allow me to recreate the whole publisihing process and I could refamliarize myself with hugo an the tools I use.

## Setting up

If you look at some of my older posts you will see I'm running Linux on my home devices and that hasn't changed. I'm running Arch Linux (BTW) on my main rig 
which is used for most my private computing, be it gaming or small code projects.  

To get Hugo running on Arch is easy like most things on Arch. Since the setup
is done and the base theme has been chosen it's time to start modifying the 
theme to suit my needs and start recreating some of the still usable blogposts
I had published back when my blog was getting weekly updates.  

Even though I'm aiming on beeing more active with the writing the reason for writing still aplies. I do it to keep my notes in a place I can easily lookup and have others lookup when needed.  

Let's see what the future brings.
