      <div class="post-content">
        <p>As a geek I do like a lot of the modern things. At work I spend my time working
with device services ranging from cloud services like Intune to things like
traditional printing in factory floors.</p>
<p>There is very little that get’s me as exited as opening a box with new hardware
in it, but from time to time I feel the hardware improvements are eaten alive
by the ever growing complexity of the software. So while I spend a lot of my
time reading about new things, I also like to go back in time and take a look
at what can be done with older hardware instead of throwing it away.</p>
<p>As an example my daughter is using a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro for her needs at the
moment. With an SSD and 8Gb of RAM it works a lot better than expected. I have
a bunch of old ThinkPad’s that have been neglected for quite some time. One of
them being an old X220, and it is the device I’m writing on at the moment.
And speaking of writing, the keyboard on this thing is second to none. I’ve
never typed on a better keyboard than the old Thinkpad’s. They are in my
personal opinion better than any of the current keyboards and so durable.</p>
<p><img src="/images/x220-001.jpg" alt="X220-001"></p>
<p><img src="/images/x220-002.jpg" alt="X220-002"></p>
<p>Considering this device was released in 2011, almost 10 years ago, it still
handles what I throw at it extremely well. I did not try Windows 10 in it
although I think it would have ran decently as well, instead it’s now running
Debian testing with the i3 window manager. A cold boot from entering the
encryption password takes about 7 seconds to the desktop. So even by modern
standards more than decent, in fact a lot faster than my 2018 MacBook Pro and
even faster than my Surface Laptop 3.</p>
<h3 id="i3-window-manager">i3 window manager</h3>
<p>Being fast does come with it’s downsides, if you don’t like them. For me, I
don’t see it as a downside, quite the opposite. As the hardware is older I set
out to use something lightweight. Tiling window managers have fascinated me for
a while now and I thought this hardware could really benefit from one. So
instead of the large WM’s in Linux I decided to go with i3 and for the login
screen Slim DM. Both extremely light and extremely configurable.</p>
<p><img src="/images/x220-scrot-001.png" alt="X220 Screenshot"></p>
<p>Finding your comfort with a tiling window manager might require some work, at
least it did for me. As an example there are things that are so wired in my
brain I have issues trying to change them. One such is the Windows + L key to
lock the computer. My i3 configuration used the VIM keys to move between open
windows, meaning H,J,K,L were bind to that movement. I changed them to the
arrow keys, not perfect, but I do need my Windows + L to lock my session.</p>
<h3 id="slimlock">Slimlock</h3>
<p>As I stated above I use Windows + L to lock my screen. This is something really
wired into my brain, leaving a computer I always do this, needed or not. i3
has this functionality in i3lock and you can call that to lock your screen. I
however wanted to use the same nice GUI that Slim provides me on startup.</p>
<p>I also wanted the system to lock whenever I put my computer to sleep or close
the lid so slimlock had to be called in those cases as well.</p>
<p>My i3 config, contains,</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The combination works exactly as I want it to.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-hardware">Changes in hardware</h2>
<p>To make the X220 a bit more modern I added 4Gb of RAM in it. I rarely go over
4Gb in this but still, as I had some laying around I gave it some additional
memory. The time of HDD’s in laptops is long gone as well, so I had a Samsung
860 SSD 1Tb driver on my table I stuffed into the laptop as well. The
combination of the SSD and 8Gb of RAM makes the X220 fly.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else I pulled the whole ting into pieces and replaced the
thermal paste on the CPU, it is as I said 10 years old so it was time to get
this done. If you have ever taken a Lenovo or IBM ThinkPad apart you start to
appreciate the way these things are built. No laptop is easy to pull apart but
with the servicing manuals and no-stress this was a enjoyable moment. I also
notice the fans rarely spool up after applying some Arctic Silver paste on the
CPU and putting everything back together.</p>
<p><img src="/images/x220-003.jpg" alt="X220 maintenance"></p>
<h2 id="can-you-really-do-something-on-it">Can you really do something on it?</h2>
<p>Counting the running laptops and desktops in my house I have 5 of them in daily
use. I really do not work on the X220 but it is able to get things done. I’ve
tried using many of the tools I use in my daily job on it and so far have not
had a single issue or noticeable dip in performance. Microsoft Teams is
probably what I spend the majority of my time collaborating in and it works
flawlessly on this device. I use O365 for email and documents, and although the
web-versions of Word, PowerPoint and Visio are not 1:1 with the desktop
version’s I can still be as effective in them. If I need a Windows desktop I
can even get into one in our Cloud services meaning I really could make this
old-timer my daily driver if I wanted to. And for my job when designing
services for the enterprise, if I can use it from this device then anyone can
use them from whatever they want.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading about Coreboot quite a bit, the next step for this old Lenovo
is to get rid of the old BIOS and clear out as much as possible from the Intel
Management Engine, I don’t have to, but I want to. Tinkering is still fun.</p>
